Name: `NAME`

ONID ID: `ONID_ID`

This assignment is intended to get you up and running with some of the tools we'll be using in this course.  It should be very straightforward.  It has two parts.

## 1. Sign up for Piazza

Use this link to sign up for CS 261 on Piazza using your ONID email address: https://piazza.com/oregonstate/fall2016/cs261

We'll be using Piazza in this course for Q&A because it's geared towards students helping other students with the class.  Anyone can post or answer a question on Piazza, even anonymously.  The instructor and TAs can revise and endorse student answers, which means you can be confident in the quality of the response.

You are *strongly encouraged* to post any class-related querstions to Piazza first instead of emailing the instructor or TAs.  You should also get in the habit of checking in to Piazza to answer other students' questions.  This will not only enable everyone to get help quickly, but it will also help you improve your understanding of the material, since teaching someone else is the best way to learn something.

As an incentive to use Piazza, a few points of extra credit will be awarded to the most active Piazza participants at the end of the class.

## 2. Use Git and GitHub

The other tool we'll be using quite a bit for this course is Git/GitHub.  You're already here looking at this assignment, so you already have some Git skills.  Practice a little more by following these steps:

1. Commit a change to this `README.md` file in which you replace `NAME` and `ONID_ID` above with your actual name and ONID ID.
